vimgitlog
=========

Git log and diff plugin for vim.

This is a simple Vim plugin that will bring up the history of a given file. It will list the history
in the window-pane on the left of the screen. If you hit enter it will diff that commit against the
current revision loaded.

TODO
----

1.  This is a work in progress. It is not finished yet, and it currently maps itself to \<f7\> which is
    bad. Will fix.

2.  Also it works of the current branch, this will change to be selectable across branches as this
    is more usefull.

3.  It is not colour coded yet, it will.
